# Password-Manager
As a user concerned about the security of your online accounts,
You want a Password Manager program !!
So that you can keep track, securely store and manage all your passwords.
If you have internet access you can access your passwords.

## Disclamer 

This is a demonstration program where fictional accounts and assioate passwords,
are stored in this case on the google cloud.
It's essential to understand you **NEVER** store passwords into the cloud !! Because,
basically put yourself in a very unconformable position to expose your privacy.
